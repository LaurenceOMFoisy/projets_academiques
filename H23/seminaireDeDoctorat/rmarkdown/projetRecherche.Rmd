# Introduction
<!-- Indiquer dès le départ le but de la recherche. -->
<!-- Peut-être aussi utiliser des intertitres? -->
For many years now, diplomatic relations between the United States and China seem to be deteriorating. Events such as the Trade war initiated in 2018, the global coronavirus pandemic which debuted in China, Beijing’s forced internment of Uyghurs in "reeducation camps" in Xinjiang, the implementation of a new national security law in Hong Kong, which reduced the autonomy of the special administrative region, America’s ban on the Chinese telecommunication giant Huawei, Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan coupled with Biden's assurance that his government would defend Taiwan against China if needed, and the allegations by the United-States that China is now sending spy balloons across the continent, all put a lot of strain on their relationship.[@bbcnewsHongKongSecurity2020; @bureauofeastasianandpacificaffairs2020HongKong2020; @collinsonWhyChineseBalloon2023; @lanteigneSpirallingEffectsSinoAmerican2020, p. 1; @u.s.departmentofthetreasuryTreasurySanctionsChinese2020]

In 2020, the United States National Security Council released a document that stated: "Given the strategic choices China's leadership is making, the United States now acknowledges and accepts the relationship with the PRC as the CCP always framed it internally: one of great power competition."[@nationalsecuritycouncilUnitedStatesStrategic2020] later that year, the FBI director declared during a speech that: "[…][the] greatest long-term threat to [America's] information and intellectual property, and to [its] economic vitality, is the counter-intelligence and economic espionage threat from China."[@wrayThreatPosedChinese2020] While many hoped that the transition from Trump to Biden in 2020 could usher in an era of stability, the Democrat president's way of dealing with China does not contrast much with that of his predecessor.[@mishraTrumpBidenContinuity2022, p. 6] The war in Ukraine and Beijing's continued relationship with Moscow made it all the more difficult for Biden to find a way to reshape Sino-American relations.[@korolevPutinXiRelationshipChina2023]

<!-- Important aussi de clarifier les propos d'Allison, de la façon que c'est écrit on croirait que c'est Allison qui dit que le conflit est évitable. -->
<!-- Félix suggère aussi d'énumérer par bullet point au lieu d'une longue liste. -->

Additionally, every time something bad happens, reputable media outlets rush to publish dramatic and alarming headlines such as "Officials Push U.S.-China Relations Toward Point of No Return"[@wongOfficialsPushChina2020], "How the U.S. Could Lose a War with China"[@gilsinanHowCouldLose2019], and "The risk of China-US military conflict is worryingly high"[@boRiskChinaUSMilitary2020] It's now common for journalists to write about a potential new cold war between the two superpowers. "The Cold War With China Is Changing Everything"[@brooks23], and "The USChina Cold War Has Already Started" [@dupontUSChinaColdWar2020].

With such a negative representation of the conflict in the media, it would be normal to believe that the relationship between both states could potentially lead to a disastrous outcome. However, looking at a simple graph of their economic relation, it's possible to notice that trade between the two countries does not seem to be affected very much by these tensions. In fact, despite a noticeable dip in trade in 2021 that can be attributed to the covid-19 pandemic, trade between the two giants has reached it's highest point in history in 2022.[@uscensusbureau23]

# Research Question

As trade is a core characteristic of bilateral economic cooperation between states, it would therefore be interesting, in order to obtain a clearer portrait of the situation, to investigate how shifts in the political relations between the United States and China influenced their trade relations and their economic cooperation more broadly. In this period of political degradation, can economic cooperation alone be enough to prevent a conflict between both states? Some scholars think so. Luckhurst, for example, argues that trade can act as an antidote to conflict as economic interdependence between the two countries raise the costs of conflict to a level that is too high for either side to bear.[@luckhurstChinaUSEconomic2016] 
This leads up to the research question. **How can the stability of the economic relationship between China and the United States be explained in the context of their increasing political disagreements?** Are trade relations directly related to political relations or are they independent? As Shambaugh wrote, "[their] relationship has been fundamentally troubled for many years and has failed to find extensive common ground to forge a real and enduring partnership."[@shambaughChinaFuture2016, p. 299] However, as Luckhurst argues and as it is possible to observe, "The governments of China and the USA have enhanced their economic cooperation since the GFC, reducing the likelihood of strategic competition leading to conflict."[@luckhurstChinaUSEconomic2016, p. 239]
<!-- Félix dit qu'il serait intéressant de préciser/détailler l’importance de la coopération économique entre USA et Chine. Par exemple, à combien s’élève les échanges commerciaux? Y a-t-il une balance commerciale déficitaire pour un pays ou l’autre? Quelles sont les plus grandes menaces? Pourquoi la relation économique est aussi importante? -->
# Literature Review

While no one argues that it is going exceptionally well between China and the United States, scholars are divided on the issue. This section will review how some of the main approaches of international relations view this situation.

## Structural Realism
Realism, a mainstream theory of international relations, offers many possible interpretations, all of which are worrisome and pessimistic. For structural realist John J. Mearsheimer, who in his 2001 book, The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, popularized the concept of Offensive Realism, a conflict is likely to happen between the United States and China. According to him, the Anarchical structure of the international system forces states to seek hegemony since it is the optimal way to maximize their security and guarantee their survival, the primary objective of every state.[@mearsheimerTragedyGreatPower2014, p. 34] In Mearsheimer's opinion, the United States should contain China's rise at all costs because as he wrote:

>If China becomes an economic powerhouse, it will almost certainly translate its economic might into military might and make a run at dominating Northeast Asia. […] The result would be an intense security competition between China and its rivals, with the ever-present danger of great-power war hanging over them.[@mearsheimerTragedyGreatPower2014, p. 37:38] 

Indeed, China has been increasing its military spending for years and now possess the second strongest military force in the world after the United States. In 2023, China announced that its yearly budget was now $224B, an increase of 7.2% from the year prior and more than double the budget of ten years ago.[@centerforstrategicandinternationalstudies15] However, this strain of realism struggles to explain how the United States and China have been able to cooperate economically for so long. If the United States, a status quo power, the most powerful state in the world, is threatened by China's rise, why does it continue to feed its growth by trading with it? While there are clear efforts being made to slow down trade such as as increasing tariffs on certain types of goods, it is unclear how effective these are. There are rising pressures from american firms for the government to remove these tariffs. @manak_etal23 argue that for a lot of these restricted products, there are simply no other alternatives than importing them from China. These product continue to be imported at a higher price which is then passed on to the consumer.

## Classical Realism
In a different fashion, Classical realism, sometimes called human nature realism, posits that it is possible to understand the behaviour of states by analyzing it through the prism of human nature. For them, it is not the structure of the international system that causes states to collide with each other but the imperfect nature of the human race which created the international system in the first place. If humans are self-centered, greedy, and hypocrites, so will the states, which they created. Human nature realists criticize Mearsheimer's structural theory for being "suspect (at best) in its logic handcuffed by the limits of its structuralism, and, ironically, rooted in utopianism — an attempt to reshape the world as one would like to see it, rather than respecting the realities of power."[@kirshnerTragedyOffensiveRealism2012, p. 70] They believe that following Mearsheimer's tenets would inevitably lead to disaster. Kirshner describes Offensive realism as a "self-fulfilling prophecy".[@kirshnerTragedyOffensiveRealism2012, p. 70] One in which there is no issue. For Hans Morgenthau, a famous theoretician of human nature realism, it is possible for states to escape conflict through wit and well-crafted diplomacy. He wrote: "This being inherently a world of opposing interests and of conflict among them, moral principles can never be fully realized, but must at best be approximated through the ever temporary balancing of interests and the ever precarious settlement of conflicts."[@morgenthauPoliticsNationsStruggle1993, p. 13] For classical realists, the behaviour of states, rational actors, can be understood through the lens of their self-interest. In the case of the rise of China, Kirshner wrote: 

>Rising powers in particular, then, are potential sources of instability because the self-definition of their interests will expand along with their increasing capabilities (and expectations of still greater power to come); classical realists also expect them to seek not just security, but also status, prestige, and even deference from others.[@kirshnerTragedyOffensiveRealism2012, p. 58]

He believes that the best way to prevent a military conflict between China and the United States is for America to engage the rising giant, acknowledge its threat, and place a greater emphasis on politics, diplomacy as well as domestic politics.[@kirshnerTragedyOffensiveRealism2012, p. 66, 68] Morgenthau also believed diplomacy was the main tool in achieving world peace. He wrote:

> As the prime requisite for the creation of [peaceful] conditions, we suggested the mitigation and minimization of those political conflicts which in our time pit the two superpowers against each other and evoke the specter of a cataclysmic war. This method of establishing the preconditions for permanent peace we call peace through accommodation. Its instrument is diplomacy.[@morgenthauPoliticsNationsStruggle1993, p. 175]

In the case of the United States and China however, it's hard to see how the two states are actively tryinig to escape conflict through wit and diplomacy. China has been accused of conducting "wolf warrior diplomacy" while the United States openly flaunt their intention to compete with China.[@martin21] It certainly appears like economic interdependence plays a much bigger role in the two countries avoiding conflict than "well crafted diplomacy" since trade is a stable constant in their relationship.

Furthermore, for classical realists, the deterioration of Sino-American diplomacy does not bode well for the future. It could be a sign that a great power competition is about to happen.

## Security Dilemma
This intense security competition is famously known as the security dilemma, a concept introduced by John Herz in 1950. He wrote: "Groups […] living in [anarchy] must be […] concerned about their security from being attacked […] by other groups […]"[@herzIdealistInternationalismSecurity1950, p. 157] The dilemma is then that even though one state might arm itself strictly for defensive reasons, it would be rational for its neighbours to want to arm themselves in return just in case, considering that states cannot know each other's true intentions in an anarchical system where self-help is the norm.[@viottiInternationalRelationsTheory2012, p. 56]

In a 2015 article name The Thucydides Trap: Are the U.S. and China headed for War? and in his subsequent 2017 book name Destined for War, Graham Allison used the security dilemma in his power transition theory called the Thucydides Trap. He gave the theory its name, referencing the ancient Greek historian Thucydides and his work on the Peloponnesian War, a conflict where "the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta"[@allisonDestinedWarCan2017, p. 21] triggered a bloody war that eventually brought all of Greece to its knee. He observed that in the past 500 years, 12 of the 16 cases of power transition, where the second world power overtook the first world power, resulted in a bloody conflict.[@allisonThucydidesTrapAre2015] Graham Allison uses his theory to demonstrate that "war between the US and China in the decades ahead is not just possible, but much more likely than currently recognized."[@allisonDestinedWarCan2017, p. 27] 

Despite its impressive mainstream success, Allison's work has been widely criticized for its flawed methodology. Richard Hanania denotes three notable methodological flaws in his research. The Second of which is omitting important variables, which according to Hanania, quoting Paul A. Jargowsky, might be "the most serious and pervasive threat to the validity of social science research."[@hananiaGrahamAllisonThucydides2021, p. 19] He shows that "[...] if we control for other variables that could determine whether rival powers end up in war, the results look much less impressive."[@hananiaGrahamAllisonThucydides2021, p. 19] For example, time might be a contributing factor in his 500 years analysis but its possible effects are not discussed in his work. States might not react the same to threats now as they did hundreds of years ago. Indeed, the world is more interdependant now than it has ever been and it does not make sense to compare states as they were before the invention of the telegraph to modern states where various information is readily available to the public and where capital can flow instantly between countries through the internet. This does not invalidate the security dilemma but it nuances its effects.

## Neo-Instutionalism
According to Bruce Russett, liberals, who tend to be more optimistic than realists, also believe in its existence but the difference is that they "[…] [see] democratic government, economic interdependence, and international law and organizations as means to overcome [it]."[@dunneInternationalRelationsTheories2013, p. 95] In the case of Sino-American relations, economic interdependence can be a likely way out of an intense security competition. Liberals acknowledge the benefits of maintaining good diplomatic relations but emphasize the significance that economic cooperation (but also other types of cooperation) has on maintaining a cordial relationship. This cooperation is enhanced by both countries' participation in a wide range of institutions such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, and the Financial Action Task Force. Keohane and Martin take a direct jab at Mearsheimer when they write: "[his] characterization of conflict in world politics makes institutions appear essential if states are to have any hope of sustained cooperation, and of reaping its benefits"[@keohanePromiseInstitutionalistTheory1995, p. 50] Indeed, for liberals, institution are a key vessel for cooperation, they allow states with divergent interests to gather and cooperate despite their differences. They write: 

>[In] a world politics constrained by state power and divergent interests, and unlikely to experience effective hierarchical governance, international institutions operating on the basis of reciprocity will be components of any lasting peace.[@keohanePromiseInstitutionalistTheory1995, p. 50]

According to institutionalists, the reason why institutions can facilitate cooperation is that they can enable a form of cheat monitoring system rendering possible credible commitments. For liberals, the fear that the other might cheat is the greatest impediment to international cooperation.[@steinCoordinationCollaborationRegimes1982 , p. 313] 

Another neo-institutionalist concept is that of Complex Interdependence. Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye defined it in terms of "reciprocal costly effects"[@keohanePowerInterdependence2012, p. 232] where costly means "[...] effects that are consequential. [That] may reduce costs, or provide benefits, as well as imposing costs."[@keohanePowerInterdependence2012, p. 232] The authors add that "These costs need not be economic but may instead involve significant effects on other values, including moral standards, aesthetic tastes, personal security, or ecological integrity."[@keohanePowerInterdependence2012, p. 232] In this way, power, viewed in absolute terms, is defined by asymmetries, where the state which is the least sensitive to cross-border flows and the least vulnerable to external events and policy alternation, has power over the other.[@keohanePowerInterdependence2012, p. 232:233]. This interdependence developped steadily since China opened up to foreign investments in the 80s and rose greatly after its entry in the World Trade Organization. While the United-States benefited greatly from China's cheap leabour and growing market, China could count on the United-States to buy its products and invest in its economy. As Joseph Nye wrote in his 2020 article Perspective for a China Strategy that "there are too many symmetries in U.S.-China interdependence at this point [for one to have power over the other], though that might change if there is a much more radical decoupling."[@nyePerspectivesChinaStrategy2020, p. 125] Both powers are proportionally sensitive to each other's actions and vulnerable to each other's policies. It's therefore in their best interest to cooperate. As @manak_etal23 wrote: 
"The American Soybean Association claimed that the trade war not only harmed U.S. soybean producers, but also made foreign competitors more appealing. For example, Brazil benefited from Chinese retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybeans, which saw a 63 percent drop in exports from January to October 2018." This is a good example of how, due to complex interdependence, the United-States can hurt its own economy by trying to hurt China's.

This relates to Keohane and Nye's Power and Interdependence. They wrote:

> Governments will argue over the distribution of gains and complain about the loss of autonomy entailed in rising economic interdependence (vulnerability as well as sensitivity); but they will generally find that, when there are domestic political demands for greater economic welfare, the welfare costs of disrupting international economic relations, or allowing them to become chaotic, are greater than the autonomy benefits. Reluctantly, they will permit economic interdependence to grow, and even more reluctantly, but inexorably, they will be drawn into cooperating in the construction of new international regimes by creating integrated policy responses. [@keohanePowerInterdependence2012, p. 34]

This paragraph alone is almost sufficient in answering the research question. Indeed, China and the United-States both face pressure from their population, althouh in different ways, to continuously improve their economic welfare. China's Communist Party's legitimacy depends, among other factors, on their capabilities to lift their population out of poverty, which it has done quite impressively in the last 40 years. The United-States, on the other hand, is a democracy where the population can vote out the government if they are not satisfied with their economic situation, which creates an incentive for the government to pursue interdependence with China in the name of economic prosperity. There are a lot of pressures from business various american business lobbies to ease tariffs with China. In 2021, collective of influential washington business associations wrote a letter to the Biden administration urging them to end end the "trade war" with China claiming it was a drag on the american economy.[@mozur_mccabe21]

The problem with Keohane and Nye's theory is that it does not account for cases where government openly claim their desire to dismantle interdependence. They believe that "[q]uite evidently, governments continually sacrifice economic efficiency to security, autonomy, and other values in policy decisions."[@keohanePowerInterdependence2012, p. 34] This applied to the Trump administration which has been very vocal about its desire to decouple from China. However, why has their trade relation kept on growing despite their desire to "decouple"? How could the "strongest" state in the system struggle with keeping its economy in sync with its international political aspirations? 

Furthermore, Nye also believes that in the globalized 21st century, both countries face mutual risk from issues such as global warming, drug trafficking, cyber-terrorism, and COVID-19, which cannot be solved unilaterally.[@nyePerspectivesChinaStrategy2020, p. 127:128] He wrote: "On many transnational issues, empowering others can help us to accomplish our own goals."[@nyePerspectivesChinaStrategy2020, p. 129] He describes the Sino-American relationship as a "cooperative rivalry" but wonders if both countries "can develop attitudes that allow them to cooperate in producing global public goods while competing in the traditional areas of great power competition."[@nyePerspectivesChinaStrategy2020, p. 130] He warns that "Exaggerated fears and worst-case analyses may make such a balanced policy impossible. [@nyePerspectivesChinaStrategy2020, p. 130]

## Constructivism
Explaining the role of exaggerated fears is where constructivists excel. China scholar Alastair Iain Johnston who in his article How New and Assertive is China’s New Assertiveness? Analyzed how the media, played an important role in creating a negative mischaracterization of Chinese foreign policy, which he believes, "reduce[s] the range of interpretations of Chinese foreign policy, potentially narrowing policy options available to decisionmaker […][and][…] could contribute to an emerging security dilemma in the U.S.-China relationship." [@johnston13, p. 7:8] He accuses the media of creating faulty conventional wisdom. He dismisses allegations that suggested a change in China’s assertiveness in 2010 by reviewing the six events the media used to support their claims and by demonstrating how the "discourse about a newly assertive China has suffered from a dearth of definitions and valid indicators"[@johnston13, p. 9] He also mentions how the media only reporting on the negative events can influence and strengthen the belief that China and the U.S. are competitors and not cooperators, thus fueling the security dilemma. [@johnston13, p. 46] Johnston wrote that the problematic analysis of China’s assertiveness "suggest[s] that the nature of the media-blogosophere[sic] interaction may become an important factor in explaining the speed and intensity of future security dilemma dynamics between […] the United States and China."[@johnston13, p. 48]

David Shambaugh, another constructivist China Scholar, also gives importance to the role of perception in shaping the public discourse about the relationship between the two giants. He wrote that "China has a very, very long way to go before it catches up with the United States […]"[@shambaughChinaFuture2016, p. 293] and that he "[…] remain[s] mystified why there is an "illusion of Chinese power" held by many around the world."[@shambaughIllusionChinesePower2014] According to the author, perception matters greatly in international relations, and the fact that people perceive that China will overtake, or has overtaken, the United States as the first world power can influence policymakers in their decisions about how to act vis-à-vis China. [@shambaughChinaFuture2016, p. 294] A good example of that is how a large chunk of the American people, whether they were Republicans or not, supported his tough stance toward China.[@silver_etal21] Knowing this, it makes it very hard for his successor to adopt a softer stance since doing so could appear as weak and displease voters. Thus, the government is kind of trapped in a situation where it has to keep on being tough on China, even if it is not in its best interest.

Furthermore, Shambaugh wrote in 2013 in his book China Goes Global that "long time observers of Sino-Americans know that there is constant ebb-and-flow, frequent frictions, and a kind of love-hate repetitive cycle in mutual images.[@shambaughChinaGoesGlobal2013, p. 139] In this way, he adds, the relationship is "never as bad as it seems, or as good as it seems."[@shambaughChinaGoesGlobal2013, p. 139] In his book 2013 Tangled Titans: The United States and China, Shambaugh argue that cooperation and competition happen simultaneously on a spectrum. He wrote: "What changes is the balance between these two features."[@shambaughTangledTitansUnited2013, p. 21] However, in his 2016 book China’s Future, the author observed that "The Sino-American relationship is finding it increasingly difficult to find a […] positive narrative and trajectory into the future."[@shambaughChinaFuture2016, p. 299] Interdependence, or, according to Shambaugh, "the fear of it falling apart", is the "[…] ‘glue’ that seems to keep them together."[@shambaughChinaFuture2016, p. 299]

Jonathan Luckhurst has a similar point of view. He wrote in his 2016 book chapter China–US Economic Cooperation as Antidote to Strategic Conflict: "There is too much at stake — economically, politically, and strategically — to let relations deteriorate significantly under the pressure of political rhetoric or security tensions."[@luckhurstChinaUSEconomic2016, p. 229] He believes that"[bilateral] economic interdependence decreases prospects for hostility by increasing perceived gains and risks from economic relations, giving incentives to reduce tensions and limit damage from political differences." [@luckhurstChinaUSEconomic2016, p. 217] This could be the "glue" that Shambaugh referred to. He demonstrates ways in which officials from both states make efforts to diverge from these negative narratives by way of discursive adjustment. He gives two examples: How China went from ‘peaceful rise’ to ‘peaceful development’ and how the United States went from ‘pivot to Asia’ to ‘rebalancing to Asia’.[@luckhurstChinaUSEconomic2016, p. 229] Luckhurst concludes his chapter by writing that "[so] long as political discourse and domestic politics in each country does not damage their relations, China–US economic cooperation should continue to be an antidote to strategic conflict."[@luckhurstChinaUSEconomic2016, p. 240]

Additionally, Wendt, a theorist of constructivism, believes there are four "Master Variables" that can help understand the collective identity formation process. They are: Interdependence, common fate, homogeneity, and self-restraint.[@wendtSocialTheoryInternational1999, p. 317] In the case of China and the United States, three of those variables seem to play a favourable role in maintaining a cooperative relationship. Interdependence, which already has been established as a core component of the relationship. Common fate, which wendt describes as distinct from interdependence. Common fate refers to something exterior. He wrote: "Interdependence means that actors' choices affect each other's outcome, and as such implies interaction. Common fate has no such implication."[@wendtSocialTheoryInternational1999, p. 349] Some examples of common-fate situations that impact sino-american relations include global warming, Cyber criminality, Covid, etc. The last variable is Self-restraint. In a situation where both states are powerful enough to easily eliminate the other, "[...] then states are constrained from going to war and thus, ironically, may be willing to trust each other enough to take on collective identity"[@wendtSocialTheoryInternational1999, p. 358] The United States and China are the first and second greatest military power in the world. They both possess nuclear weapons and have the capacity to destroy each other. This could be a factor that contributes to the maintenance of a cooperative relationship.

# Theory
Wendt believed that there might have been more variables than four and that understanding how those variables worked to form a larger model was a theoretical problem in itself.[@wendtSocialTheoryInternational1999, p. 365] This research will be using his theory and the theory of those who have built upon it to understand how the economic relation of China and the United States relates to their political relationship. 

Constructivism is a fundamentally different theory than realism or liberalism because it strays away from positivism and rationalism. It is a theory that focuses on the role of ideas and norms in shaping international relations. It emphasizes the role of a multitude of actors in international relations and the intersubjectivity between them. Fierke wrote: "Constructivists embrace an intersubjective ontology, emphasizing norms, social agents, and structures, and the mutual constitution of identity."[@dunneInternationalRelationsTheories2013, p. 193] Each state is composed of individuals with their agency and identity, acting according to what they believe is in their interest. What matters here is that their actual interest may differ from their perceived interest. Indeed, people will tend to act according to their perception of reality, not reality itself. This perception is shaped by their identity, which is itself shaped by their social surroundings which is shaped shaped by the individuals which it comprises. This is what constructivists call intersubjectivity. 

Actors behaviours are bound by the norms and the social structure they are subjected to or have been influenced by, coming from their family, employer, religious group, society, or other forms of social groups. In the words of Jonathan Luckhurst: "Agency is context-dependent and social, existing in complex flows of interactions and processes; individuals are reflexive, but not isolated from the constitutive effects of practices and shifts in background knowledge."[@luckhurstGovernanceNetworksShaping2019, p. 3] Individuals, who in the pursuit of their self-interest, wish to alter the economic, political, or social norms and structure, can then form groups with other individuals with similar interests. These groups can get bigger and gain more importance or can be influenced by bigger groups. Through what Johnston calls micro-processes — "[…] the susceptibility of structures to minor perturbations, contingencies, nonlinearity, and path dependence set in motion by the conscious reflection and action of agents of change"[@johnstonSocialStatesChina2008, p. xiv:xv] — these groups can influence actions of states. According to Johnston, this socialization process should matter a lot when studying the behaviour of states.[@johnstonSocialStatesChina2008, p. xv] 

Therefore, to understand bilateral relations between states, it is important to analyze and understand the socialization process happening between them and within each of them. Every head of state of every country will be different from the others and will have a different vision for its country, different personal interests, different methods of governance, a different education, a different history, will evolve in a different political context, will have different social surroundings, different reasons for why they are in power, different people whom they owe favours to, a different understanding of what is right or wrong, different perceptions of other states, etc. Additionally, heads of state are not the only ones making decisions within a state. Elected or unelected officials, each with different aspirations, maybe working for a specific lobby, maybe with the desire to improve the social condition of his electors; CEOs of Multinational companies courting the government; NGOs and civil society actors working to rally the population under certain causes; Ambassadors, tasked with improving the standings of his state with another. Each of these actors, their specificities, the role they play within their state, and the influence they have in the bilateral relations of their country adds a level of complexity to the analysis, but reviewing them makes it more accurate, nuanced, and reliable.

This is why realism is important in understanding the Sino-American relation as most Chinese IR scholars and a sizable portion of its political class tend to agree with it.[@zhangTrumpEffectChina2020, p. 241; @shambaughChinaGoesGlobal2013, p. 49, 66] It is, therefore, possible to assume that certain Chinese policymakers are likely to act according to the dictates of the theory in response to actions made by the United States, and that the United States policymakers, knowing this, might act in a preventive way, anticipating "realist" actions from China. The fact that Allison's book was so popular among statesmen is a good indicator of what kind of ideology circulates among American decision-makers.[@hananiaGrahamAllisonThucydides2021, p. 13] This kind of ideational propagation could increase tensions and fuel their security dilemma. 

Additionally, as most scholars agree, the United States and China are interdependent, which means that altering their relationship can generate costly effects which need to be taken into account in the analysis.[@luckhurstChinaUSEconomic2016, p. 219; @nyePerspectivesChinaStrategy2020, p. 125; @zhangTrumpEffectChina2020, p. 242; @kirshnerTragedyOffensiveRealism2012, p. 59] Keohane and Nye define costly effects as "effects that people care about. [Effects that] generate concern—and politics."[@keohanePowerInterdependence2012, p. 232] The way these effects are perceived by the people in power, either positively or negatively, will vary greatly. This again underlines the impact of human agency and contingency in the decision-making process. Different leaders might evaluate the cost of these effects in different ways, leading to different policy orientations.

As Wendt wrote: "Social theories do not determine the content of our international theorizing, but they do structure the questions we ask about world politics and our approaches to answering those questions."[@wendtAnarchyWhatStates1992, p. 422] If realism is seeing the world as it is and liberalism is seeing the world as we want it to be, then constructivism is understanding how others see the world. In this manner, it can act as a bridge between important and useful elements of each theory of international relations. It can acknowledge the role self-interested human nature plays in international politics while retaining room for structural analysis and the effects it can have on the behavior of states. It also recognizes the role of institutions and does not see power as inherently absolute or relative. Constructivism offers malleability and a deep level of analysis which can help understand a specific set of events, and their context, in a situation where there are so many contradicting theories and speculations.

# Conclusion

<!-- Important de faire ressortir l'originalité de la thèse. Comment puis-je me démarquer ? -->
<!-- Je devrais aussi aborder le concept de fongibilité de la puissance. -->
<!-- Peut-être important de clarifier qui sont les "scholars" cités? Leur spécialité ? -->
<!-- Aussi incorporer des petits paragraphes de conclusion qui viennent résumer les différentes parties ? -->
<!-- Félix écrit: il aurait été bien d’avoir une conclusion qui résume de manière succincte les objectifs du projet de recherche et les principales théories mobilisées pour répondre à la question de recherche. Et ce qu’il vise à identifier précisément. -->

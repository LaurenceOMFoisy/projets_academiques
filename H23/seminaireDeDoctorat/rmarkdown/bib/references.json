  {"id":"allisonDestinedWarCan2017","abstract":"\"CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE HEADING TOWARD A WAR NEITHER WANTS. The reason is Thucydides's Trap, a deadly pattern of structural stress that results when a rising power challenges a ruling one. This phenomenon is as old as history itself. About the Peloponnesian War that devastated ancient Greece, the historian Thucydides explained: \"It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta that made war inevitable.\" Over the past 500 years, these conditions have occurred sixteen times. War broke out in twelve of them. Today, as an unstoppable China approaches an immovable America and both Xi Jinping and Donald Trump promise to make their countries \"great again,\" the seventeenth case looks grim. Unless China is willing to scale back its ambitions or Washington can accept becoming number two in the Pacific, a trade conflict, cyberattack, or accident at sea could soon escalate into all-out war. In Destined for War, the eminent Harvard scholar Graham Allison explains why Thucydides's Trap is the best lens for understanding U.S.-China relations in the twenty-first century. Through uncanny historical parallels and war scenarios, he shows how close we are to the unthinkable. Yet, stressing that war is not inevitable, Allison also reveals how clashing powers have kept the peace in the past -- and what painful steps the United States and China must take to avoid disaster today\"--","author":[{"family":"Allison","given":"Graham T."}],"citation-key":"allisonDestinedWarCan2017","event-place":"Boston","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"364","publisher":"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt","publisher-place":"Boston","title":"Destined for war: can America and China escape Thucydides's trap?","title-short":"Destined for war","type":"book"},

  {"id":"herzIdealistInternationalismSecurity1950","abstract":"The heartbreaking plight in which a bipolarized and atom bomb-blessed world finds itself today is but the extreme manifestation of a dilemma with which human societies have had to grapple since the dawn of history. For it stems from a fundamental social constellation, one where a plurality of otherwise interconnected groups constitute ultimate units of political life, that is, where groups live alongside each other without being organized into a higher unity.\n            Wherever such anarchic society has existed—and it has existed in most periods of known history on some level—there has arisen what may be called the ‘security dilemma’ of men, or groups, or their leaders. Groups or individuals living in such a constellation must be, and usually are, concerned about their security from being attacked, subjected, dominated, or annihilated by other groups and individuals. Striving to attain security from such attack, they are driven to acquire more and more power in order to escape the impact of the power of others. This, in turn, renders the others more insecure and compels them to prepare for the worst. Since none can ever feel entirely secure in such a world of competing units, power competition ensues, and the vicious circle of security and power accumulation is on.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Herz","given":"John H."}],"citation-key":"herzIdealistInternationalismSecurity1950","container-title":"World Politics","container-title-short":"World Pol.","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1950]]},"language":"en","page":"157-180","title":"Idealist Internationalism and the Security Dilemma","type":"article-journal","volume":"2"},
  {"id":"johnston13","abstract":"There has been a rapidly spreading meme in U.S. pundit and academic circles since 2010 that describes China's recent diplomacy as “newly assertive.” This “new assertiveness” meme suffers from two problems. First, it underestimates the complexity of key episodes in Chinese diplomacy in 2010 and overestimates the amount of change. Second, the explanations for the new assertiveness claim suffer from unclear causal mechanisms and lack comparative rigor that would better contextualize China's diplomacy in 2010. An examination of seven cases in Chinese diplomacy at the heart of the new assertiveness meme finds that, in some instances, China's policy has not changed; in others, it is actually more moderate; and in still others, it is a predictable reaction to changed external conditions. In only one case—maritime disputes—does one see more assertive Chinese rhetoric and behavior. The speed and extent with which the newly assertive meme has emerged point to an understudied issue in international relations—namely, the role that online media and the blogosphere play in the creation of conventional wisdoms that might, in turn, constrain policy debates. The assertive China discourse may be a harbinger of this effect as a Sino-U.S. security dilemma emerges.","author":[{"family":"Johnston","given":"Alastair Iain"}],"citation-key":"johnston13","container-title":"International Security","container-title-short":"International Security","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"7-48","title":"How New and Assertive Is China's New Assertiveness?","type":"article-journal","volume":"37"},

One prominent realist approach, associated with John Mearsheimer, calls for the US to do whatever it can to slow China’s rise. However, while this is a realist perspective, it is not the realist perspective. In particular, realist approaches that derive from a classical foundation suggest policies fundamentally different from those favored by Mearsheimer. T  his article argues that realism should return to some of its classical traditions. It reviews why, from a classical realist perspective, the rise of China must be viewed with alarm, but argues that Mearsheimer’s approach — offensive realism — is wrong, and dangerous. Many of these errors are rooted in structuralism; a classical realist approach, which allows for the influence of history and politics, provides greater analytical purchase and wiser policy prescriptions than offensive realism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Kirshner","given":"Jonathan"}],"citation-key":"kirshnerTragedyOffensiveRealism2012","container-title":"European Journal of International Relations","container-title-short":"European Journal of International Relations","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","page":"53-75","title":"The tragedy of offensive realism: Classical realism and the rise of China","type":"article-journal","volume":"18"},

It examines G20 policyshaping capacities of global governance networks, especially on macroprudential ﬁnancial regulation, sustainable economic growth, and sustainable development.

  {"id":"steinCoordinationCollaborationRegimes1982","abstract":"The study of regimes can contribute to our understanding of international politics only if regimes represent more than international organizations and less than all international relations. The conceptualization of regimes developed here accepts the realist image of international politics, in which autonomous self-interested states interact in an anarchic environment. Yet there are situations in which rational actors have an incentive to eschew unconstrained independent decision making, situations in which individualistic self-interested calculation leads them to prefer joint decision making (regimes) because independent self-interested behavior can result in undesirable or suboptimal outcomes. These situations are labeled dilemmas of common interests and dilemmas of common aversions. To deal with these, states must collaborate with one another or coordinate their behavior, respectively. Thus there are different bases for regimes, which give rise to regimes with different characteristics. Coordination is self-enforcing and can be reached through the use of conventions.

The article elucidates the assumptions of such an interest-based approach to regimes, assimilates alternative explanations into this framework, and develops the implications for regime maintenance and change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Stein","given":"Arthur A."}],"citation-key":"steinCoordinationCollaborationRegimes1982","container-title":"International Organization","container-title-short":"Int Org","DOI":"10.1017/S0020818300018968","ISSN":"0020-8183, 1531-5088","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1982]]},"language":"en","page":"299-324","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Coordination and collaboration: regimes in an anarchic world","title-short":"Coordination and collaboration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0020818300018968/type/journal_article","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"wendtAnarchyWhatStates1992","abstract":"The claim that international institutions can transform state interests is central to neoliberal challenges to the realist assumption that \"process\" (interaction and learning among states) cannot fundamentally affect system \"structure\" (anarchy and the distribution of capabilities). Systematic development of this claim, however, has been hampered by the neoliberals' commitment to rational choice theory, which treats interests as exogenously given and thus offers only a weak form of institutional analysis. A growing body of international relations scholarship points to ways in which the identities and interests of states are socially constructed by knowledgeable practice. This article builds a bridge between this scholarship and neoliberalism by developing a theory of identity- and interest-formation in support of the neoliberal claim that international institutions can transform state interests. Its substantive focus is the realist view that anarchies are necessarily self-help systems, which justifies disinterest in processes of identity- and interest-formation. Self-help is a function not of anarchy but of process and, as such, is itself an institution that determines the meaning of anarchy and the distribution of power for state action. The article concludes with an examination of how this institution can be transformed by practices of sovereignty, by an evolution of cooperation, and by critical strategic practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Wendt","given":"Alexander"}],"citation-key":"wendtAnarchyWhatStates1992","container-title":"International Organization","ISSN":"0020-8183","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1992]]},"page":"391-425","publisher":"[MIT Press, University of Wisconsin Press, Cambridge University Press, International Organization Foundation]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Anarchy is what States Make of it: The Social Construction of Power Politics","title-short":"Anarchy is what States Make of it","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2706858","volume":"46"},

  {"id":"zhangTrumpEffectChina2020","abstract":"\"This book delves into the life and work of President Donald Trump, who is arguably the most famous and controversial person in the world today. While his administration has received enormous attention, few have studied the spatial dimensions of his policies. Political Landscapes of Donald Trump explores the geographies of Trump from multiple conceptual standpoints. It contextualizes Donald and his rise to power within the geography of his victory in 2016. Several essays in the book are concerned with his white ethno-nationalist political platform and social bases of support. Others focus on Trump's use of Twitter, his ties to professional wrestling, and his innumerable lies and deceits. Yet another set delves into the geopolitics of his foreign policies, notably in Cuba, Korea, the Middle East, and China. Finally, it covers how his administration has addressed - or failed to address - climate change and its treatment of undocumented immigrants. This book will be of interest to anyone interested in the Trump administration, as well as social scientists and the informed lay public\"--","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiang"}],"call-number":"E912","citation-key":"zhangTrumpEffectChina2020","container-title":"Political landscapes of Donald Trump","editor":[{"family":"Warf","given":"Barney"}],"event-place":"Abingdon, Oxon","ISBN":"978-0-429-24267-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"280-297","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"Abingdon, Oxon","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The Trump Effect in China","type":"chapter"}

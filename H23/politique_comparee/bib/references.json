  {"id":"helleiner19","abstract":"In a widely cited 1982 article, John Ruggie identified the normative framework of Bretton Woods as ‘embedded liberalism’ and pointed to its enduring legacy in international economic governance through the 1970s. Revisiting Ruggie’s analysis at the 75th anniversary of Bretton Woods, I advance three arguments about the content and legacy of embedded liberalism in the international monetary and financial system. First, the embedded liberalism of Bretton Woods was an even more innovative normative framework than Ruggie’s important article suggested, involving a new commitment to a form of institutionalized liberal multilateralism that was compatible with various kinds of active public management of the economy. Second, in the 1944–1980 period, embedded liberalism was more contested and malleable than is often understood, as it coexisted with important alternative normative frameworks and as distinct varieties of embedded liberalism emerged in international monetary and financial governance. Third, in the post-1980 era, scholars have correctly highlighted a ‘neoliberalization’ trend in international monetary and financial governance, but assessments of the degree of the challenge posed to embedded liberalism by this trend need to be nuanced. They also risk overlooking different and newer kinds of challenges to embedded liberalism arising from growing opposition to institutionalized liberal multilateralism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Helleiner","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"helleiner19","container-title":"Review of International Political Economy","container-title-short":"Review of International Political Economy","DOI":"10.1080/09692290.2019.1607767","ISSN":"0969-2290, 1466-4526","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,2]]},"language":"en","page":"1112-1135","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The life and times of embedded liberalism: legacies and innovations since Bretton Woods","title-short":"The life and times of embedded liberalism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09692290.2019.1607767","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"jervis78","abstract":"International anarchy and the resulting security dilemma (i.e., policies which increase one state's security tend to decrease that of others) make it difficult for states to realize their common interests. Two approaches are used to show when and why this dilemma operates less strongly and cooperation is more likely. First, the model of the Prisoner's Dilemma is used to demonstrate that cooperation is more likely when the costs of being exploited and the gains of exploiting others are low, when the gains from mutual cooperation and the costs of mutual noncooperation are high, and when each side expects the other to cooperate. Second, the security dilemma is ameliorated when the defense has the advantage over the offense and when defensive postures differ from offensive ones. These two variables, which can generate four possible security worlds, are influenced by geography and technology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Jervis","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"jervis78","container-title":"World Politics","container-title-short":"World Pol.","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1978]]},"language":"en","page":"167-214","title":"Cooperation under the Security Dilemma","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"johnston13","abstract":"There has been a rapidly spreading meme in U.S. pundit and academic circles since 2010 that describes China's recent diplomacy as “newly assertive.” This “new assertiveness” meme suffers from two problems. First, it underestimates the complexity of key episodes in Chinese diplomacy in 2010 and overestimates the amount of change. Second, the explanations for the new assertiveness claim suffer from unclear causal mechanisms and lack comparative rigor that would better contextualize China's diplomacy in 2010. An examination of seven cases in Chinese diplomacy at the heart of the new assertiveness meme finds that, in some instances, China's policy has not changed; in others, it is actually more moderate; and in still others, it is a predictable reaction to changed external conditions. In only one case—maritime disputes—does one see more assertive Chinese rhetoric and behavior. The speed and extent with which the newly assertive meme has emerged point to an understudied issue in international relations—namely, the role that online media and the blogosphere play in the creation of conventional wisdoms that might, in turn, constrain policy debates. The assertive China discourse may be a harbinger of this effect as a Sino-U.S. security dilemma emerges.","author":[{"family":"Johnston","given":"Alastair Iain"}],"citation-key":"johnston13","container-title":"International Security","container-title-short":"International Security","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"7-48","title":"How New and Assertive Is China's New Assertiveness?","type":"article-journal","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"nye08","abstract":"Soft power is the ability to affect others to obtain the outcomes one wants through attraction rather than coercion or payment. A country's soft power rests on its resources of culture, values, and policies. A smart power strategy combines hard and soft power resources. Public diplomacy has a long history as a means of promoting a country's soft power and was essential in winning the cold war. The current struggle against transnational terrorism is a struggle to win hearts and minds, and the current overreliance on hard power alone is not the path to success. Public diplomacy is an important tool in the arsenal of smart power, but smart public diplomacy requires an understanding of the roles of credibility, self-criticism, and civil society in generating soft power.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Nye","given":"Joseph S."}],"citation-key":"nye08","container-title":"The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science","container-title-short":"The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science","DOI":"10.1177/0002716207311699","ISSN":"0002-7162, 1552-3349","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,3]]},"language":"en","page":"94-109","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Public Diplomacy and Soft Power","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0002716207311699","volume":"616"},

  {"id":"ruggie82","abstract":"The prevailing model of international economic regimes is strictly positivistic in its epistemological orientation and stresses the distribution of material power capabilities in its explanatory logic. It is inadequate to account for the current set of international economic regimes and for the differences between past and present regimes. The model elaborated here departs from the prevailing view in two respects, while adhering to it in a third. First, it argues that regimes comprise not simply what actors say and do, but also what they understand and find acceptable within an intersubjective framework of meaning. Second, it argues that in the economic realm such a framework of meaning cannot be deduced from the distribution of material power capabilities, but must be sought in the configuration of state-society relations that is characteristic of the regime-making states. Third, in incorporating these notions into our understanding of the formation and transformation of international economic regimes, the formulation self-consciously strives to remain at the systemic level and to avoid becoming reductionist in attributing cause and effect relations. The article can therefore argue that the prevailing view is deficient on its own terms and must be expanded and modified. Addressing the world of actual international economic regimes, the article argues that the pax Britannica and the pax Americana cannot be equated in any meaningful sense, and that the postwar regimes for money and trade live on notwithstanding premature announcements of their demise.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruggie","given":"John Gerard"}],"citation-key":"ruggie82","container-title":"International Organization","ISSN":"0020-8183","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1982]]},"page":"379-415","publisher":"[MIT Press, University of Wisconsin Press, Cambridge University Press, International Organization Foundation]","source":"JSTOR","title":"International Regimes, Transactions, and Change: Embedded Liberalism in the Postwar Economic Order","title-short":"International Regimes, Transactions, and Change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2706527","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"wendt92","abstract":"The claim that international institutions can transform state interests is central to neoliberal challenges to the realist assumption that \"process\" (interaction and learning among states) cannot fundamentally affect system \"structure\" (anarchy and the distribution of capabilities). Systematic development of this claim, however, has been hampered by the neoliberals' commitment to rational choice theory, which treats interests as exogenously given and thus offers only a weak form of institutional analysis. A growing body of international relations scholarship points to ways in which the identities and interests of states are socially constructed by knowledgeable practice. This article builds a bridge between this scholarship and neoliberalism by developing a theory of identity- and interest-formation in support of the neoliberal claim that international institutions can transform state interests. Its substantive focus is the realist view that anarchies are necessarily self-help systems, which justifies disinterest in processes of identity- and interest-formation. Self-help is a function not of anarchy but of process and, as such, is itself an institution that determines the meaning of anarchy and the distribution of power for state action. The article concludes with an examination of how this institution can be transformed by practices of sovereignty, by an evolution of cooperation, and by critical strategic practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Wendt","given":"Alexander"}],"citation-key":"wendt92","container-title":"International Organization","ISSN":"0020-8183","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1992]]},"page":"391-425","publisher":"[MIT Press, University of Wisconsin Press, Cambridge University Press, International Organization Foundation]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Anarchy is what States Make of it: The Social Construction of Power Politics","title-short":"Anarchy is what States Make of it","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2706858","volume":"46"},
